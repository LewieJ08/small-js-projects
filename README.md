# üìÅ Small JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of small JavaScript projects! This repository serves as a personal learning space where I explore the fundamentals of JavaScript through simple, focused scripts.

Although I come from a Python background, I'm currently learning JavaScript and using these projects to build fluency in the language ‚Äî from syntax and control structures to functions and logic flow. Each project is self-contained and designed to reinforce core programming concepts in JavaScript.

## üí° Why Node.js?

All projects in this repository are run using **Node.js**, allowing me to focus purely on JavaScript as a programming language without involving the browser or working with HTML/CSS at this stage. This approach helps build a solid understanding of JavaScript's behavior and logic on its own.

## Projects
1. [Calculator](/calculator/main.js)
2. [Weight Converter](/weight-converter/main.js)
3. [Temperature Converter](/temp-converter/main.js)

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Run

To run any project:

1. Make sure you have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) installed.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Run the script using:

```bash
node filename.js
```
