# üìÅ Small JavaScript Projects

Welcome to my collection of small JavaScript projects! This repository is a personal learning space where I explore and strengthen my understanding of JavaScript ‚Äî starting with core language fundamentals and now expanding into frontend development using HTML and CSS.

Originally, this repo focused solely on Node.js projects so I could learn JavaScript as a programming language, without distractions from browser APIs or styling. Now, I'm expanding this repo to include browser-based projects that combine JavaScript with HTML and CSS, as I learn how to build interactive user interfaces and dynamic web pages.
